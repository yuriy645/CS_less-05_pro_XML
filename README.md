## My homework for the C# Professional course, less-05_pro_XML
1. Create an .xml file that meets the following requirements:
    - filename: TelephoneBook.xml
    - root element: “MyContacts”
    - tag “Contact”, and it should contain the name of the contact and the attribute “TelephoneNumber” with the value of the phone number.
2. Create an application that displays all the information about the specified .xml file.
3. From the TelephoneBook.xml file (the file must have been created during an additional task), output
    only phone numbers appear on the screen.
4. Create a WPF Application, in the main window of which place any text. Also,
    there should be a settings window (can be implemented using TabControl). The user can
    change settings. When you restart the application, the settings should remain the same.
    Implement two options (in one application or two different ones):
    1) saving settings in the configuration file;
    2) saving settings in the registry.
    In the settings window, implement the following options: background color, text color, font size, font style, and a button
    "Save". To select a color, use the ColorPicker, following the example of the task from Lesson #3.
